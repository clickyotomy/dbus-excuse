dbus-excuse
-----------

The Bastard Operator From Hell excuse server that runs on `dbus',
inspired by http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ballard/bofh/.


BUILD

	To install dependencies for the server, run "scripts/dep.sh".
	This may need root permissions.

	To build the server binary, run

		$ make

	... at the root of the repository. The binary will be
	named "dbus-excuse".

	To test the build binary inside a `dbus' sesson, run:

		$ make test


USAGE

	The server can be started within a `dbus' session with:

		$ make start

	Sending messages to the server can be done via `dbus-send'.

		# Make a RPC request to the server. The address of the bus
		# can be obtained by parsing "/proc/<daemon-pid>/environ" to
		# get the "DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" environment variable.
		$ dbus-send --bus=${BUS_ADDR}" --print-reply \
			--dest='org.bofh' '/' 'org.bofh.loop.excuse'

		# Stop the server.
		$ dbus-send --bus=${BUS_ADDR}" --print-reply \
			--dest='org.bofh' '/' 'org.bofh.loop.stop'

	To clean build artifacts and stale `dbus' sockets, run:

		$ make clean


WHY
	Q: Why does this even exist?
	A: I wanted to have some fun with `dbus'.
